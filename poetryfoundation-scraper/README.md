# poetryfoundation-scraper
Scraper for Poetry Foundation Website

*Usage*
Simply run the scraper with no arguments and it will prompt you for a poet. After you enter the poet's name, if it is a valid poet on the site, the program will proceed to download all of the poet's works to a text file. 

Keep in mind that there is no error handling here, and the url creation is very stupid. Nevertheless, I hope this helps you in your endeavors to combine the arts with computer science.

This was created as a tool to populate a Markov Model and generate poems. See the PDF file titled ```selection1``` for more details. Enjoy!

I've since edited it to make it work for python 3 :)
